# IL2CPU
IL2CPU is a compiler for .NET IL code to compile to assembly language for direct booting.

# Status
Currently IL2CPU is used by the [C# Open Source Managed Operating System (COSMOS)](http://www.goCosmos.org) and parts of it are bound to Cosmos. We are in the process of and nearly finished separating out IL2CPU to allow it to operate as a stand alone project to allow users to make their own custom creations using IL2CPU.
